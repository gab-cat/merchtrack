# Security Policy

## Introduction
The security of the **MerchTrack Repository** is of utmost importance. This policy outlines the measures and practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. All contributors and users must adhere to these guidelines to maintain a secure environment.

---

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it immediately to the security team. Do not disclose the issue publicly until it has been resolved.

- **Contact**: security@merchtrack.com
- **Process**:
  1. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability.
  2. Include steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
  3. Share any relevant logs, screenshots, or code snippets.
- **Response Time**: The security team will acknowledge your report within 24 hours and provide a resolution timeline.

## Security Practices

### Authentication and Authorization
- Use **Clerk** for secure authentication and session management.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive resources.
  ```javascript
  if (user.role === "admin") {
    // Grant access
  }
  ```
- Enforce strong password policies (minimum 12 characters, mix of letters, numbers, and symbols).

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g., AES-256, TLS 1.3).
- Use environment variables to store sensitive information such as API keys and database credentials.
  ```env
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/merchtrack"
  ```
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other injection attacks.
  ```javascript
  const sanitizedInput = escape(userInput);
  ```

### Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies to their latest secure versions.
- Use tools like `npm audit` or `pnpm audit` to identify and fix vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  ```sh
  pnpm audit
  ```

### Code Security
- Avoid using `eval()` or other functions that execute arbitrary code.
- Use **Zod** for input validation to ensure data integrity.
  ```javascript
  const userSchema = z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    age: z.number().positive(),
  });
  ```
- Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
  ```javascript
  try {
    // Code logic
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("An error occurred:", error.message);
  }
  ```

### Monitoring and Logging
- Log security-related events (e.g., failed login attempts, access control violations).
- Use monitoring tools to detect and respond to suspicious activities in real-time.
- Ensure logs do not contain sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys).

### Secure Development Lifecycle
- Conduct security reviews and code audits for all new features and changes.
- Use static analysis tools like **SonarQube** to identify potential security issues.
- Perform regular penetration testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Incident Response
In the event of a security breach, follow these steps:

1. **Contain**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
2. **Assess**: Determine the scope and impact of the breach.
3. **Mitigate**: Apply fixes to address the vulnerability.
4. **Communicate**: Notify affected users and stakeholders.
5. **Review**: Conduct a post-incident review to prevent future occurrences.

---

## Compliance
The **MerchTrack Repository** adheres to the following security standards and regulations:
- **GDPR**: Ensures data protection and privacy for users in the European Union.
- **OWASP Top Ten**: Addresses common web application security risks.
- **PCI DSS**: Complies with payment card industry data security standards (if applicable).

---

## Training and Awareness
- Provide regular security training for all contributors and users.
- Promote a culture of security awareness and best practices.

---

## Policy Review
This security policy will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed to address emerging threats and changes in the project.
